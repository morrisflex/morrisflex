## Hi dear,  My name is Morris.

A software engineer who focusses on helping organisations improve the world through the use of software engineering technologies.

Over the past few years, I have worked on several incredible projects, including community websites, school management software, landing pages, a browser extension, and an online conference app for event planners.  It's a minor boast, but I'm quite proud that I'm among the top 0.8% of active GitHub users in my nation.

I've gained a great deal of expertise in:
Front-end: jQuery | HTML5 | CSS3 | SASS | Typescript | NextJs | Redux | JavaScript | React | Tailwind
Back-end: MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and MySQL
Tools & Techniques: Webpack | Heroku | Netlify | TDD | Chrome Dev Tools | Mobile/Responsive Development | Git | GitHub.
Professional: Project management, teamwork, mentoring, remote pair programming, documentation, and advanced technical writing.

Devoted to conceiving, developing, and manufacturing from the ground up consumer-focused technologies and technology-enabled goods.  open to investigating fascinating full-stack development opportunities at both startups and established businesses.
